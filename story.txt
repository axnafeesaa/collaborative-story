One day, our GitHub project came to life...

In a quiet village nestled between emerald hills, a curious boy named Sami found an old, dusty key buried beneath the roots of a giant oak tree. No one knew where it came from, but one moonlit night, it led him to a hidden door in the hillside that shimmered with golden light. As the key turned, the door creaked open to reveal a forgotten world of talking animals and floating lanterns. From that day on, Sami visited often, learning secrets of the forest and becoming the youngest guardian of its magical realm.
